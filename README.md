# Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems

This exercise focuses on real-time network analysis to identify suspicious behavior. It involves using common cybersecurity tools to examine network traffic, detect unusual activity, and extract information contained within the network data.

This lab consists of four sections:

**Section 1**: Installation and setup of Suricata, an open-source, high-performance network threat detection engine used for IDS, IPS, and NSM, along with Evebox, a GUI tool for managing and analyzing security events generated by Suricata.
 
**Section 2**: Analysis of a pcap file from January 2023 showing evidence of malware infection by AgentTesla. It demonstrates scanning the pcap file with Suricata and using Evebox to investigate alerts.
 
**Section 3**: Similar analysis process using Suricata and Evebox to uncover evidence of IcedID malware.
 
**Section 4**: Repetition of the process to identify the presence of AZORult malware.
 
The lab emphasizes using Suricata and Evebox for effective network threat detection and investigation.
